# Getkirby Starterkit with Laravel-Vite Plugin and CUBEcss boilerplate

This is a fork of the [vite-starterkit](https://github.com/lukaskleinschmidt/vite-starterkit) provided by [lukaskleinschmidt](https://github.com/lukaskleinschmidt), that demonstrates how to implement the [laravel-vite plugin](https://github.com/lukaskleinschmidt/kirby-laravel-vite) for [Kirby CMS](getkirby.com). I adapted the [cubecss](https://cube.fyi/) [boilerplate](https://github.com/Set-Creative-Studio/cube-boilerplate) provided by [Andy Bell](https://bell.bz/) from [Set Studio](https://set.studio/).

I use it for testing purposes, but of course feel free to use any part you want. 
>[!IMPORTANT]
>[Kirby CMS](getkirby.com) requires a license, once a project is available by a public url.

**Kirby: the CMS that adapts to any project, loved by developers and editors alike.**
The Starterkit is a full-blown Kirby installation with a lot of example content, blueprints, templates and more.
It is ideal for new users to explore many of Kirby's options and get to know the Panel.

You can learn more about Kirby at [getkirby.com](https://getkirby.com).

### Try Kirby for free

You can try Kirby and the Starterkit on your local machine or on a test server as long as you need to make sure it is the right tool for your next project. … and when you’re convinced, [buy your license](https://getkirby.com/buy).

The Starterkit is a demo of basic Kirby features. It's not recommended to be used "as is" in production. Please, follow our documentation closely for more features and guides on how to build secure, high-quality websites with Kirby.

While Kirby as the CMS software itself requires you to purchase a license, we consider the files primarily connected to this Starterkit (assets, templates, snippets...) free to use under the MIT license. Feel free to start building your own project with them.
